#RussiaBot
This is a Reddit-bot, made for [/r/russia](https://www.reddit.com/r/russia).
It goes through the new submissions in the subreddit, and checks for Russian language.
If it finds a post with Russian language, it will use Google Translate to create a
comment in the submission, with the title translated to English.
