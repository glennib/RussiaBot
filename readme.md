#RussiaBot
This is a Reddit-bot, made for [/r/russia](https://www.reddit.com/r/russia).
It goes through the new submissions in the subreddit, and checks for Russian language.
If it finds a post with Russian language, it will use Google Translate to create a
comment in the submission, with the title translated to English.

I'm all new to Python, so the structuring might not be good at all. This is an
introductory project for me to learn working with libraries and Reddit.
